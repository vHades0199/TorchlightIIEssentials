Sadly, the day has come when we need to open the Armory once again.  But the door was built to keep us out, at all costs, which is why the Ezrohir cannot get in ... and why the Golden Gear is so vital to us.

And if he is trying to protect the Guardian of the Wild, he may have already infected the Guardian with the mysterious illness that has affected so many Estherians ... the same malady that appears to have turned them into ravening Nether-Thralls!

They caused considerable damage to the cities, and devastated the land, until the Zeraphi sultan had had enough.  He banished them both: one to the desert, and one to ... another place.  A shadow realm, between this world and the endless void where the Netherim dwell.\\n\\nIf you can reach Fazeer Shah, you might be able to convince him to help us."

  - original: Centuries ago, the sage Anom-Irek devised a method of identifying and even curing Estherians who had become corrupted by the evil spirits known as Netherim. We have not been troubled by their ilk ever since.\n\nThe attack by the Alchemist, however, and the subsequent sickness, reminded me of descriptions of Netherim possession ... so I came here to seek Anom-Irek's cure.  My hope was to steal into the crypt and return before the Sturmbeorn arrived, but, as you can see, I was too late.

Now they are keeping her under guard at Riftkeep, their fortress in the Salt Barrens, until they are ready to launch their attack on Zeryphesh.\n\nThings are getting desperate, but the Guardian of Air has suggested a way that Mana might still be saved.  The magical bonds placed upon the Guardian of Mana are beyond the abilities of the Guardians to remove, but, out in the Salt Barrens, there abides a powerful djinni named Fazeer Shah.  This djinni can easily undo the Artificer's work, but you have to find him first ... and then convince him to help.

We will conquer all of Vilderan, then cross the sea and enslave your primitive human "empire!"  You will toil in the mines for a thousand generations, and ensure that your master rules for eternity!\n\nWait here, human.  And rejoice!  Once I have reclaimed my power from the Vault of Souls, I shall make you the first of a dynasty of slaves.

Our military leader, Commander |cFFD1FF7AMuzaffar|u, has apparently been captured by the Ezrohir, out in the |cFFD1FF7AOssean Wastes|u.  They'll have sent for inquisitors to take their prisoners back to their stronghold.  Once they get him to Riftkeep, they'll identify him quickly enough, and then they'll interrogate him until they know everything about our defenses.\n\nI believe you're going out to the |cFFD1FF7AOssean Wastes|u.  Please, rescue |cFFD1FF7AMuzaffar|u. We need him.

I think he might have contracted the same sickness affecting the other Estherians.

  - original: Hello again! I think I may be able to repay the favor you've done for us.\n\nI've been doing some research, and have uncovered some interesting information about |cFFD1FF7AVyrax|u, the ancient dragon who still dwells in the tower in |cFFD1FF7ARivenskull Gorge|u. He was bound there by his brother, |cFFD1FF7AThiss|u - whose spectral form lies beneath us in these |cFFD1FF7AForgotten Halls|u.\n\nThe interesting bit is this - |cFFD1FF7AVyrax|u has amidst his hoard a |cFFD1FF7AHeartfire Stone|u, which confers to its wielder the power of |cFFD1FF7Adragonfire|u. It is a rare and powerful artifact that would surely aid you. If you can find the key below, you may be able to enter |cFFD1FF7AVyrax's Tower|u and claim the |cFFD1FF7AHeartfire Stone|u for yourself!

  - original: Hello there!  I wonder if you have a moment to help me out?  My name is |cFFD1FF7ANerasis|u; I'm an Ember surveyor for the Empire.  I've been working on a theory that used Ember can be recharged, with exposure to a suitably large source of mana.  My research led me to |cFFD1FF7ATarroch's Rift|u, where the mana output ratio is ... well, it's very high.\n\nThe problem is that there are quite a few horrible monsters between me and the mana source.  I would be willing to pay you to take this burned-out |cFFD1FF7ASpent Ember|u into |cFFD1FF7ATarroch's Rift|u and attempt to charge it, then bring it back here so I can see if my theory is correct.

We've been unable to open it ourselves, but we know how in theory. See that dwarven automaton? It's designed to open the door, but it's missing its |cFFFFBA00Power Source|u. There should be one in the |cFFFFBA00Scrapworks|u, but it was too dangerous for us to enter. Perhaps you will have more luck.\n

  - original: Let me tell you a little about Ember Truffles.  Lots of plants and even some animals absorb Ember essence, if they're exposed to high enough concentrations of it.  Those plants and animals can be harvested, and the Ember distilled out of them, to make it absorbable by humans.  This work is mainly done by Imperial Alchemists which is probably what happened to the guy you're looking for.\n\nBut sometimes, in the wild, plants and animals absorb Ember and it changes them.  They begin to move by themselves.  Some of them even develop a rudimentary intelligence.  Most of the time, that's not too horrific but, when the plant or animal is big or dangerous enough, well, they can get pretty vicious.  You've probably even faced one or two creatures that have absorbed a little too much Ember.

  - original: My friend, I have a mission for you.  You may have noticed the Ezrohir activity in the Ossean Wastes.  We believe these are scouts operating out of the |cFFD1FF7AForsaken Vaults|u, but they are appearing so close to the city gates that we think they might have a base much nearer, from which they are spying on us.\n\nWe have narrowed down the possibilities, and I want you to look into the |cFFD1FF7ATower of the Moon|u, in the |cFFD1FF7AOssean Wastes|u.  Determine if there are any Ezrohir scouts there ... and if you find any, deal with them.
    translation: ""
  - original: My friend, I need your help!  My squad and I had observed a group of Ezrohir moving in and out of the |cFFD1FF7AUndercurrents|u. They have installed machines to pump a virulent poison into the city's water supply.  Their "Manatoxin" is specifically designed to disrupt Zeraphi physiology. Unfortunately, the noxious atmosphere seems to have attracted a horde of poisonous beasts, and I only just escaped with my life.  If you can enter the |cFFD1FF7AUndercurrents|u and destroy those machines for me, I will reward you.  What do you say?
    translation: ""
  - original: "My friend, thank you for coming to our aid.  We are a Zeraphi envoy from Zeryphesh, in the Ossean Wastes, sent to procure the Estherians' aid in our upcoming war with the Ezrohir.  Grand Regent Eldrayn gave us leave to search the Frosted Hills for the Golden Gear, and we had narrowed our search to this area before we were assaulted by these goblins.\\n\\nNow we are too injured to continue our search.  Can you aid us?  Search the |cFFD1FF7AFrosted Hills|u for three components: the |cFFD1FF7ACrest of Pools|u, the |cFFD1FF7ACrest of Rivers|u, and the |cFFD1FF7ACrest of Tides|u. Bring them to me, and I will reward you, on behalf of the Zeraphi people."

  - original: My husband Finnas and I were on our way to the Estherian Enclave.  We're homesteaders, with a small farm in the Frosted Hills.  The weather is getting harsh, so we were making one last run for supplies before winter.  We only looked away for a moment, and our little darlings wandered into that nasty cave!

The slavers' leader has them caged, in the cavern below the lake here.  A trapdoor outside one of the nearby huts leads to the cavern.\n\nPlease, in the name of the Guardians ... you must free them!
    translation: ""
  - original: My thanks, human!  From what these Ezrohir scum said, their torturers were on their way, and I had precious little hope of holding out against their methods ... let alone escaping.\n\nI need to remain here, to ensure that these other captives make it safely back to Zeryphesh, but I have further need of you, if you have the time.

  - original: So ... the Alchemist enslaved the Guardian of Mana ... and then just handed her over to the Ezrohir?
    translation: ""
  - original: So ... you finally found your way out.  You are the most entertaining diversion I've found in a thousand years!\n\nWell, I suppose you'll be needing one final task ...
    translation: ""
  - original: So long as it endures, you are never truly defeated.
    translation: ""
  - original: So what kind of monster was it? I never saw it ... I was too busy running.\n\nWhat? No monster? But, then, why would those soldiers say there was one ... unless ...\n\nSay, you don't think they were lying to me, do you?\n\nWait! You don't think they weren't really soldiers, do you?\n\nI am so gullible.
    translation: ""
  - original: So, the Professor sent you after the |cFFD1FF7APower Source|u?   We were on the same mission, but the only way to the Scrapworks is through that pile of rock.\n\nI know the |cFFD1FF7AAbandoned Sawmill|u used to have plenty of explosives from when the place was still in operation - a little bit of |cFFD1FF7Adynamite|u would probably get the job done here. \n\nI sent my troop after it, but haven't heard a thing.  If you can head up there and get that dynamite, we could all pass through and get the Professor what he needs.\n
    translation: ""
  - original: So, yeah. I'm a dealer in ... "antiquities," like. See? This and that, nothing special. "Estate" stuff, you might say. I deal with anybody's got an ... antiquity ... what they don't need no more, right? They're not usin' it anymore, so I sell it for 'em.\n\nOnly sometimes I have to deal with people what can't be trusted, if you know what I mean. I dig stuff up, sell it on to these people, and pocket a small ... "commission," like.\n\nBut my latest, well, "buyers" ... these guys don't understand how business works. They took my ... |cFFEAAA15antiquity|u ... and didn't pay me!\n\nThink you can convince them to hand over my ... antiquity? I'll pay you good money ...
    translation: ""
  - original: So, you're going after the Alchemist?  I might be able to help you.  I'm a botanist, serving the Empire by gathering various Ember-infused plants.  And I've found a virtual treasure trove of |cFFD1FF7AEmber Truffles|u, down in the |cFFD1FF7AMuckery|u but some of them have already attained sentience, and that's making it difficult for me to gather them.\n\nIf you can bring me, say, a dozen |cFFD1FF7AEmber Truffles|u, I'll keep ten for the Empire, and I'll use the other two to make a |cFFD1FF7ASuper Mana Potion|u for you.  Do we have a deal?
    translation: ""
  - original: So!  You retrieved the Lamp of Wonders!  Your pitiful struggles do provide some small entertainment after all.\n\nYou can throw that piece of  junk away.  It's just a lamp with a pretentious name. It doesn't actually do anything, although I suppose you could put some oil in it and use it to provide light ...\n\nThis second task should prove much more amusing.
    translation: ""
  - original: So...you come seeking the wealth of Grom? My spoils are vast, and have no peer in this realm.\n\nThere is no path to success for you, lest you survive my arena and prove your worth.\n\nBe forewarned - many have tested their mettle on this bloodstained floor, but none have yet succeeded. Their souls are now mine, and they do as they are bid.\n\nWill you attempt the challenge? I will await your decision below.

But in our quest for immortality, we fractured: The Ezrohir embraced the faster path of Ember-fueled suits of armor, while the Zeraphi sought a \"safer\" alchemical method.  But the Ezrohir demanded the Zeraphi Ember ... then waged war on the Estherians for theirs ... and, finally, demanded that I grant them access to the Vault of Souls.  I refused, and rather than let them take the Vault, I sank the Eternal Palace itself in the Bay of Stars.  In their fury, they bound me with chains and hurled me in after, to rule the bottom of the sea.  Now the waters have long since receded, and neither Zeraphi or Ezrohir remember the king who can use the power of the Vault of Souls to bring them together again."

    translation: ""

    translation: ""
  - original: We are relatively safe here, but the brutish Sturmbeorn will surely destroy everything that isn't made of gold!  The temple is home to thousands of years of historical artifacts and documents, and it grieves me immeasurably to think of all of those treasures lost!\n\nWe were able to gather up some of the artifacts, as we fled, but the Bronze Head of Grunnheim was left behind!  Please, find it!  Some of its records are the only accounts we have of major historic events!
    translation: ""
  - original: We are very fortunate that you came along, human.  Distracted as we were by the Sturmbeorn invasion ... and with the Guardians weakened by the Alchemist ... this Nether-plague would have swept through the Estherians in a matter of days.

  - original: We aren't ready for the siege yet.  Even if you can't rescue the Guardian of Mana, we need you to buy us some time, to finish preparing our defenses.
    translation: ""
  - original: We can reinforce the city gates, and barricade the postern doors.  But we have to be ready for them to attack from another direction.
    translation: ""

  - original: We got some news that you took out the leader of the Sturmbeorn!  You even met a Guardian!  Sounds like you're really going places!
    translation: ""
  - original: We had thought at first that these slavers would simply pass through the area, but the slavers have been steadily fortifying this camp for weeks now, which tells me that they have no intention of leaving any time soon.\n\nIt would appear that, with the Sturmbeorn invasion, business is too good.  The Estherians are easy targets right now, and will be, until we recover from all of this chaos.  The slavers will only make that recovery more difficult, unless they are persuaded to leave.
    translation: ""
  - original: We have been weakening the structure of some of the buildings in the Empty Quarter, so that the Ezrohir cannot use them as cover.
    translation: ""
  - original: We lost serious pressure in the primary Ember feed.  We've got an auxiliary line ... but that's no way to get around!
    translation: ""
  - original: We must act quickly. It appears that the Artificer you defeated in the Vaults has enslaved the Guardian of Mana for the enemy. The most pressing danger is that they will use the enslaved Guardian to corrupt ... and control ... all the world's magic. Our only recourse in that event may be to destroy the Guardian.\n\nThere might still be hope. If we can find a way to free the |cFFFFBA00Guardian|u from Ezrohir control, we can save Zeryphesh, and thwart the Alchemist's plans.
    translation: ""
  - original: We need more power!
    translation: ""
  - original: We need more troops at the south gate.  If we're lucky, the Guardian of Mana will be back soon, with the troops she took with her.

    translation: ""

    translation: ""
  - original: We're nearly there, my friend!  Stand back while I activate the |cFFFFBA00Automaton|u!\n\nI don't know what we'll encounter in there.  We know that the Alchemist went that way, and he won't have made it easy for anyone to follow him.\n
    translation: ""
  - original: We're seeing a few troops coming back in from out of the Ossean Wastes.  They say you're doing good work out there.  Keep it up!
    translation: ""
  - original: We've been trying to get through the Great Door for weeks. We determined that the door was missing its power source, and were beginning to mount an expedition to the Scrapworks to find a replacement. The Alchemist attacked before we could act.
    translation: ""
  - original: We've got a lot of injuries, here ... but it could've been a lot worse.  As powerful as the Alchemist is, we got real lucky.
    translation: ""
  - original: We've got the Estherian Steppes handled. Go get some well-deserved rest.
    translation: ""

    translation: ""
  - original: We've tangled with the Sturmbeorn a few times since we got here.  Them or the ratlins jump us every time we try to move supplies up the pass, to the Estherian city.  I hope the Commander comes back with some relief soon.

  - original: When the Zeraphi and Ezrohir "parted ways," they designated the nearby fortress of Riftkeep as a neutral ground, where they could meet and talk over their differences.  But it has remained unused for centuries ... until a few weeks ago, when the Ezrohir army seized the fortress.  They have occupied it ever since, and that is surely where they are holding the Guardian of Mana while they marshal their forces.\n\nThe Ezrohir will be expecting the Zeraphi to attack them at Riftkeep, to attempt to rescue the Guardian.  But they know it will take time for the Zeraphi to arrive.  You can get there much more quickly, and fight your way inside before they are prepared to repel you.
