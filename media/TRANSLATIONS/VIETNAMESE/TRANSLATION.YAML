      It appears you were too late!  The Alchemist has already reached the

      "There must be a way to increase the Heart's power ... perhaps by drawing
      it from the elemental Guardians?  Their power is incomprehensibly vast,
      and any one of them could 'super-charge' Ordrak's Heart to more than equal
      the task.  But would draining away that energy kill the Guardian?  Would
      its associated element then run amok ... or vanish altogether?  I must
      spread the 'donation' across multiple Guardians.  The Guardians are
      unlikely to willingly part with that energy; I must take what I need, and
      pray that there is time for apologies later."

      Armory.  We sealed the Armory shut by means of the Golden Gear, then sent
      the Gear to the Estherians as a gesture of our peaceful intentions. 
      Sadly, the day has come when we need to open the Armory once again.  But
      the door was built to keep us out, at all costs, which is why the Ezrohir
      cannot get in ... and why the Golden Gear is so vital to us.

      Back at the Enclave, you learned that a strange, magical sickness has been
      spreading among the Estherians ever since the Alchemist's attack.  There
      is also a strong possibility that Grand Regent Eldrayn is carrying the
      disease, and he is already en route to the Watchweald Temple, to see to
      the protection of the Guardian of the Wild.\n\nIf the Grand Regent spreads
      this mystery illness to the Guardian, it could mean the end of all plants
      and animals, everywhere in the world!

      Zeryphesh.\n\nThings are getting desperate, but the Guardian of Air has

      upon the Guardian of Mana are beyond the abilities of the Guardians to
      remove, but, out in the Salt Barrens, there abides a powerful djinni named
      Fazeer Shah.  This djinni can easily undo the Artificer's work, but you
      have to find him first ... and then convince him to help.

      Greetings, my friend!  Welcome to Zeryphesh!  I am Malik Vosh.  I speak
      for the Zeraphi.\n\nAs you know, the Ezrohir are preparing to assault our
      city.  Our military leader, Commander |cFFD1FF7AMuzaffar|u, has apparently
      been captured by the Ezrohir, out in the |cFFD1FF7AOssean Wastes|u. 
      They'll have sent for inquisitors to take their prisoners back to their
      stronghold.  Once they get him to Riftkeep, they'll identify him quickly
      enough, and then they'll interrogate him until they know everything about
      our defenses.\n\nI believe you're going out to the |cFFD1FF7AOssean
      Wastes|u.  Please, rescue |cFFD1FF7AMuzaffar|u. We need him.

      Greetings, o insignificant one.\n\nAh, yes ... I know of this Artificer. 
      He came to me, seeking the secret of binding a Guardian ... but I refused
      his entreaties.  Instead, he turned to my ancient foe, the despicable
      Ezrek Khan, who was all too eager to teach him such abominable
      rituals.\n\nOf course, whatever Ezrek Khan has done, I can undo.

      Greetings, traveler.  Can you assist me?  I was traveling with the Grand
      Regent, to the Watchweald Temple, when we became separated.  I was hoping
      to rejoin him at the temple ... but the doors have been sealed behind
      him.  He was very ill, when I last saw him.  I think he might have
      contracted the same sickness affecting the other Estherians.

      Hello again! I think I may be able to repay the favor you've done for
      us.\n\nI've been doing some research, and have uncovered some interesting
      information about |cFFD1FF7AVyrax|u, the ancient dragon who still dwells
      in the tower in |cFFD1FF7ARivenskull Gorge|u. He was bound there by his
      brother, |cFFD1FF7AThiss|u - whose spectral form lies beneath us in these
      |cFFD1FF7AForgotten Halls|u.\n\nThe interesting bit is this -
      |cFFD1FF7AVyrax|u has amidst his hoard a |cFFD1FF7AHeartfire Stone|u,
      which confers to its wielder the power of |cFFD1FF7Adragonfire|u. It is a
      rare and powerful artifact that would surely aid you. If you can find the
      key below, you may be able to enter |cFFD1FF7AVyrax's Tower|u and claim
      the |cFFD1FF7AHeartfire Stone|u for yourself!

      Hello there!  I wonder if you have a moment to help me out?  My name is
      |cFFD1FF7ANerasis|u; I'm an Ember surveyor for the Empire.  I've been
      working on a theory that used Ember can be recharged, with exposure to a
      suitably large source of mana.  My research led me to |cFFD1FF7ATarroch's
      Rift|u, where the mana output ratio is ... well, it's very high.\n\nThe
      problem is that there are quite a few horrible monsters between me and the
      mana source.  I would be willing to pay you to take this burned-out
      |cFFD1FF7ASpent Ember|u into |cFFD1FF7ATarroch's Rift|u and attempt to
      charge it, then bring it back here so I can see if my theory is correct.

    string|TRANSLATION: ''

      It only took one dropped dwarven gear to get Zugmeister to design these
      boots.

  - string|ORIGINAL: It packs quite a punch.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It plays a tune you have never heard.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''

    string|TRANSLATION: ''

      done, though, and, if my gratitude means anything to you, you have it.

      It seems suspicious that so many Estherians are coming down ill, so soon
      after the Alchemist attacked the city.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: >-
      It seems that even the Grand Regent was not strong enough to fight off the
      Netherim corruption.  As I recall, he was one of those who had survived
      the plague at the Retreat.  Perhaps some small seed of the Nether-Beasts
      had taken root in his spirit, and left him vulnerable once again ...
    string|TRANSLATION: ''

      It seems that the illness the Alchemist brought upon us will do what the
      Sturmbeorn failed to accomplish.

    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It serves you ... but you can also feel its hatred for you.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It shatters and splinters and ends in a tomb.

  - string|ORIGINAL: It shines with inner light.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''

    string|TRANSLATION: ''

  - string|ORIGINAL: It smells of rotten beets
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It smolders with power.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''

    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It speaks to you in the voices of your friends ...
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It started out as a hangman's hood; it still smells of death.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It strikes like the bite of a dragon.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It takes a moment to catch your breath.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''

      It was a brutal fight, getting up here through that bear-infested pass. 
      We lost a lot of good soldiers, and most of who we have left are injured.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It was crafted from an ice-wolf's pelt.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: >-
      It was going to conquer the world, but the Empire withdrew funding. Only
      the prototype remains.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It was once the badge of office of the man known only as the Oathbreaker.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It was used to slay the Eight-Legged Lord, in the Frosted Hills.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It weighs both sides of the argument, and returns justice.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It weighs heavily upon you.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It whispers in your ear.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It whispers to you in mournful dwarven syllables.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It whispers to you in the voices of long-dead Embermages.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It whispers to you in your own voice, casting spells in your mind.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: >-
      It would seem that I am dying.  To have lived so long, to have endured so
      much ... only to die of a fever ...
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It wraps you in its dark embrace.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It'll help you keep your head together, when nothing else will.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It'll keep you warm at night, when nothing else will.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It's a horse.

    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It's all in your head.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: >-
      It's all up to you now.  If you cannot stop the Ezrohir, they will raze
      Zeryphesh.  And the two Guardians will tear each other apart ... along
      with most of the desert.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It's all you ever wanted! Until something better comes along.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It's almost as if the skull exploded from the inside.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: >-
      It's almost as though the Alchemist wanted to reward you for defeating him
      ...
    string|TRANSLATION: ''

    string|TRANSLATION: ''

    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It's cold and slick.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''

      It's curious that the Ezrohir didn't attack as soon as they had the
      Guardian of Mana under their control ...
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It's engraved with strange symbols.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''

    string|TRANSLATION: ''

  - string|ORIGINAL: It's good to be alive!
    string|TRANSLATION: ''

      It's good to know that someone else made it through!  Does this mean Echo
      Pass is finally clear of the Sturmbeorn?
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: >-
      It's good to see you again, my friend!  I know that I promised you a
      greater reward, should you come to visit ... but that was before I
      returned to the Ossean Wastes and found the |cFFD1FF7ACelestial Armory|u
      under siege by Ezrohir.\n\nWhat if I give you your choice of artifacts
      from the Armory?  You have but to use the |cFFD1FF7AGolden Gear|u to get
      inside, then activate the |cFFD1FF7AArmory Portal|u, which will allow us
      to gather up the weapons and armor safely ... with the Ezrohir none the

      It's pretty clear the Alchemist was here, but bugged out, probably right
      before he went to Torchlight.  The place is still full of monsters,
      though, so watch your back in there.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''
  - string|ORIGINAL: It's quite light.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''

      Let me tell you a little about Ember Truffles.  Lots of plants and even
      some animals absorb Ember essence, if they're exposed to high enough
      concentrations of it.  Those plants and animals can be harvested, and the
      Ember distilled out of them, to make it absorbable by humans.  This work
      is mainly done by Imperial Alchemists which is probably what happened to
      the guy you're looking for.\n\nBut sometimes, in the wild, plants and
      animals absorb Ember and it changes them.  They begin to move by
      themselves.  Some of them even develop a rudimentary intelligence.  Most
      of the time, that's not too horrific but, when the plant or animal is big
      or dangerous enough, well, they can get pretty vicious.  You've probably
      even faced one or two creatures that have absorbed a little too much
      Ember.

      My friend, I have a mission for you.  You may have noticed the Ezrohir
      activity in the Ossean Wastes.  We believe these are scouts operating out
      of the |cFFD1FF7AForsaken Vaults|u, but they are appearing so close to the
      city gates that we think they might have a base much nearer, from which
      they are spying on us.\n\nWe have narrowed down the possibilities, and I
      want you to look into the |cFFD1FF7ATower of the Moon|u, in the
      |cFFD1FF7AOssean Wastes|u.  Determine if there are any Ezrohir scouts

      My friend, I need your help!  My squad and I had observed a group of
      Ezrohir moving in and out of the |cFFD1FF7AUndercurrents|u. They have
      installed machines to pump a virulent poison into the city's water
      supply.  Their "Manatoxin" is specifically designed to disrupt Zeraphi
      physiology. Unfortunately, the noxious atmosphere seems to have attracted
      a horde of poisonous beasts, and I only just escaped with my life.  If you
      can enter the |cFFD1FF7AUndercurrents|u and destroy those machines for me,
      I will reward you.  What do you say?

      My friend, thank you for coming to our aid.  We are a Zeraphi envoy from
      Zeryphesh, in the Ossean Wastes, sent to procure the Estherians' aid in
      our upcoming war with the Ezrohir.  Grand Regent Eldrayn gave us leave to
      search the Frosted Hills for the Golden Gear, and we had narrowed our
      search to this area before we were assaulted by these goblins.\n\nNow we
      are too injured to continue our search.  Can you aid us?  Search the
      |cFFD1FF7AFrosted Hills|u for three components: the |cFFD1FF7ACrest of
      Pools|u, the |cFFD1FF7ACrest of Rivers|u, and the |cFFD1FF7ACrest of

      My husband Finnas and I were on our way to the Estherian Enclave.  We're
      homesteaders, with a small farm in the Frosted Hills.  The weather is
      getting harsh, so we were making one last run for supplies before winter.

      The barrier between our world and the Nether is most fragile at the

      My thanks to you, human.  After the temple fell, and these slavers set
      upon us refugees, I feared that our fates were sealed.\n\nBut I am not the
      only prisoner.  The slavers' leader has them caged, in the cavern below
      the lake here.  A trapdoor outside one of the nearby huts leads to the
      cavern.\n\nPlease, in the name of the Guardians ... you must free them!

      My thanks, human!  From what these Ezrohir scum said, their torturers were
      on their way, and I had precious little hope of holding out against their
      methods ... let alone escaping.\n\nI need to remain here, to ensure that
      these other captives make it safely back to Zeryphesh, but I have further
      need of you, if you have the time.

      known treatment is produced from the flesh of the |cFFD1FF7ABlue Boletus|u

      here. I find that they are, ah, BIGGER than I had anticipated, however.

      the Alchemist everything. Ordrak was once a Guardian, of sorts, and his
      heart is more powerful than they imagine. Certainly, the Netherim have
      corrupted it, but, if it were put to a good use... such as rejuvenating

      Blight.  These tiny infections grow, and, eventually, develop into a
      conduit for Netherim.  The victim becomes a host to the Netherim: a
      "Nether-Thrall."\n\nThis is what happened to the Estherians.  And, for
      some reason, the effect was stronger with the Grand Regent.  Perhaps he
      was exposed more directly when he battled the Alchemist.  In any case, the
      thing that possessed the Regent, the thing that attempted to possess me,
      is more powerful than the others:  It is a Nether-Beast ... one of the
      Netherim Kings who led the invasion of our world an age ago.  I am sure it
      will return, seeking vengeance.

      of a vicious struggle.  The total count of dead and missing has risen to
      sixteen.\n\nThe wolves in the area are showing a peculiar aggression,
      snarling and slinking outside the stockade walls - they seem to smell the
      fear here.\n\n- Cameron

      We are relatively safe here, but the brutish Sturmbeorn will surely
      destroy everything that isn't made of gold!  The temple is home to
      thousands of years of historical artifacts and documents, and it grieves
      me immeasurably to think of all of those treasures lost!\n\nWe were able
      to gather up some of the artifacts, as we fled, but the Bronze Head of
      Grunnheim was left behind!  Please, find it!  Some of its records are the
      only accounts we have of major historic events!

      We are very fortunate that you came along, human.  Distracted as we were

      in a matter of days.

      We aren't ready for the siege yet.  Even if you can't rescue the Guardian

      We had thought at first that these slavers would simply pass through the
      area, but the slavers have been steadily fortifying this camp for weeks
      now, which tells me that they have no intention of leaving any time
      soon.\n\nIt would appear that, with the Sturmbeorn invasion, business is
      too good.  The Estherians are easy targets right now, and will be, until
      we recover from all of this chaos.  The slavers will only make that
      recovery more difficult, unless they are persuaded to leave.
    string|TRANSLATION: ''

      We must act quickly. It appears that the Artificer you defeated in the
      Vaults has enslaved the Guardian of Mana for the enemy. The most pressing
      danger is that they will use the enslaved Guardian to corrupt ... and
      control ... all the world's magic. Our only recourse in that event may be
      to destroy the Guardian.\n\nThere might still be hope. If we can find a
      way to free the |cFFFFBA00Guardian|u from Ezrohir control, we can save
      Zeryphesh, and thwart the Alchemist's plans.

      We've been trying to get through the Great Door for weeks. We determined

      weapons, armor, trinkets, and the like.  Or, rather, I would, if I hadn't
      lost my enchantment kit!\n\nMaybe you can help me.  I've heard there's a
      Beornen shaman or something out in the |cFFD1FF7APath of the Honored
      Dead|u, who has the kind of enchanting tools I need.  If you could locate
      this bear-mage and acquire those tools, I would happily give you your

      Shoals|u, the |cFFD1FF7AKing of the Crabs|u is negotiating with a
      representative of the Ezrohir, to provide the Ezrohir with a huge cache of
      scrap metal they have salvaged.  The Ezrohir will use that scrap to forge
      more arms to bring against us!  They must be stopped!\n\nI beg you:  Go
      down into the |cFFD1FF7ADead Shoals|u and prevent the |cFFD1FF7ACrab
      King|u from concluding his negotiations with the Ezrohir!
